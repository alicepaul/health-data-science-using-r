# Preface {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This book serves as an interactive introduction to R for public health and health data science students. Topics include data structures in R, exploratory analysis, distributions, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and larger scale programming with functions and control flows. The presentation assumes knowledge with the underlying methodology and focuses instead on how to use R to implement your analysis.

This book is written using Quarto Book. You can download the Quarto files used to generate this book or a corresponding Jupyter Notebook from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alicepaul/health-data-science-using-r). The GitHub repository also contains a few [cheat sheets](https://github.com/alicepaul/health-data-science-using-r/tree/main/book/refs).
