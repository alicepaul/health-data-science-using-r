        "As you write more complex code and functions, we want to focus on\n",
        "practicing good programming principles. This will help you when you need\n",
        "to share or update your code or when you inevitably run into errors or\n",
        "unexpected behavior. Below are some general programming tips and how\n",
        "they relate to communication and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Consistent naming.** Use consistent and informative names for your\n",
        "    objects and functions. For example, you can see that within this\n",
        "    text we have only used lowercase letters, underscores (`_`), and\n",
        "    occasionally numbers in our names. These names should also be\n",
        "    informative and unique. This makes it easier to check for typos or\n",
        "    duplicate names when debugging. When debugging, check whether you\n",
        "    use the same name for different objects or whether you use different\n",
        "    names for the same object. You can do this by using the `ls()`\n",
        "    function to find all current objects or by checking your environment\n",
        "    pane.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ``` r\n",
        "    # Recommended\n",
        "    ages <- c(65, 33, 27, 88)\n",
        "    age_mean <- mean(ages)\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Not recommended\n",
        "    x <- c(65, 33, 27, 88)\n",
        "    x1 <- mean(ages)\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Make Your Code Readable.** Readable code requires several elements\n",
        "    of communication. Similar to writing an essay, we need to break our\n",
        "    code into digestible and structured pieces. First, code should be\n",
        "    broken into blocks, using white space to separate steps, and should\n",
        "    use correct levels of indentation (one extra level of indentation\n",
        "    for each new loop, if/else statement, or function). This means that\n",
        "    closing curly braces should be on their own line indicating the end\n",
        "    of the block. This will make it easy to check that all parentheses\n",
        "    (), brackets \\[\\], and curly braces {} match. Additionally, you\n",
        "    should use line breaks to avoid going over 80 characters on a single\n",
        "    line of code. RStudio has an option to reformat or re-indent your\n",
        "    code under the Code tab.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Besides the structure of your code, writing helpful comments and\n",
        "    function documentation are key for making your code readable. A good\n",
        "    rule of thumb is to write comments for yourself a year from now -\n",
        "    you might remember the project goal but you won’t remember what `x`\n",
        "    represents. You likely do not need a comment for every line of code\n",
        "    but you might need one to explain the overall goal of a block of\n",
        "    code or to explain any lines of code that do not stand for\n",
        "    themselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "    In the code below, we have not used indentation. This makes it hard\n",
        "    to see the structure of the code such as what lines of code are in\n",
        "    the loop or if statement. The function does not have any roxygen\n",
        "    documentation. However, we have added too many comments. The\n",
        "    comments here are repetitive with the code. Last, we named the\n",
        "    function `unique()`, which is already a function in R.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ``` r\n",
        "    # Not recommended\n",
        "    unique <- function(x){\n",

        "    if (length(x) == 0){ # check length 0\n",
        "    return(NULL)} # return NULL\n",
        "    for(i in length(x)){  # loop through x\n",

        "\n",
        "3.  **Don’t Repeat Yourself.** Whenever we are repeating code, we are\n",
        "    more likely to introduce errors. Additionally, it makes it hard to\n",
        "    update our code later on. When we find ourselves repeating code, we\n",
        "    should use a function. If you find yourself repeating constants you\n",
        "    should define these values as an object. The code below uses a\n",
        "    single line of code to convert categorical variables to factors and\n",

        "                        heart_rate = c(60, 82, 76, 72),\n",

        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Practice Reading Documentation.** Whenever we are using a new\n",
        "    function, you should read the documentation first. When debugging,\n",
        "    you should check that the input arguments to a function match what\n",
        "    is expected and check the examples. Reading these examples will also\n",
        "    help when writing your own documentation so you can better\n",
        "    understand how to communicate to your audience.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Start Simple, Build Up.** If we write a large amount of code at\n",
        "    once and then it fails to work, it’s hard to understand what went\n",
        "    wrong. Instead, we should build up our code or functions in small\n",
        "    steps and check it after each step. When it comes to testing code, a\n",
        "    good mantra is *test early and test often*. So, try to avoid writing\n",
        "    too much code before running and checking that the results match\n",
        "    what you expect. If you do end up writing a big chunk of code, you\n",
        "    can use localize your error by checking the values of objects at\n",
        "    different points.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Get Comfortable Asking for Help.** In software engineering, it’s a\n",
        "    known tip to have a rubber ducky (or other adorable object) at your\n",
        "    desk to talk through your code. Having to verbalize and explain your\n",
        "    approach can be really helpful for debugging. R’s error messages can\n",
        "    sometimes hint at what the error might stem from, but they are not\n",
        "    always direct. Searching for error messages you don’t understand\n",
        "    might give you a better understanding of the problem.\n",
