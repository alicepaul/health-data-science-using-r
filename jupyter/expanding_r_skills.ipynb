For example, you can see that within this text we have only used lowercase letters, underscores (`_`), and occasionally numbers in our names. These names should also be informative and unique. This makes it easier to check for typos or duplicate names when debugging. When debugging, check whether you use the same name for different objects or whether you use different names for the same object. You can do this by using the `ls()` function to find all current objects or by checking your environment pane."

First, code should be broken into blocks, using white space to separate steps, and should use correct levels of indentation (one extra level of indentation for each new loop, if/else statement, or function). This means that closing curly braces should be on their own line indicating the end of the block. This will make it easy to check that all parentheses (), brackets \\[\\], and curly braces {} match. Additionally, you should use line breaks to avoid going over 80 characters on a single line of code. RStudio has an option to reformat or re-indent your code under the Code tab.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Besides the structure of your code, writing helpful comments and function documentation are key for making your code readable. A good rule of thumb is to write comments for yourself a year from now - you might remember the project goal but you won't remember what `x` represents. You likely do not need a comment for every line of code but you might need one to explain the overall goal of a block of code or to explain any lines of code that do not stand for themselves.\n",
