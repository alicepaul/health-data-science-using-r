For example, the following code runs a random walk 100 times in serial. Parallel processing allows us to execute multiple calls to this function at the same time. This is done by running these processes on separate cores, or processors, on your machine. For example, if we had six cores available we would be able to run 1/6 of the replications on each processor and reduce our overall computation time. The **parallel** package [@R-parallel] contains functions to implement parallel processing on different operating systems. Unfortunately, this functionality is often not supported within RStudio and is not covered in this book. We recommend using the `mclapply()` function from the **parallel** package to implement parallel processing using forking. This does not work on Windows but is much simpler to implement. For parallel processing on Windows, we recommend looking into the socket approach using the `parLapply()` function in the **parallel** package."
