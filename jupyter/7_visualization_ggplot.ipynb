        "Another way to visualize data by group is to add a facet wrap to your ggplot object. Facets divide a plot into subplots based on one or more discrete variable values. We can either arrange these plots as a grid where the rows and/or columns correspond to the variables we are grouping by using `facet_grid()` and specifying the column and row variables using the `col` and `row` arguments respectively. Or we can wrap the plots into a rectangular format using `facet_wrap()` and specifying the columns using the `facet` argument. Below, we take one of our previous plots and add a facet grid where the columns of the grid are given by racial group. If we had set `row=vars(PAT_RACE_CAT)`, then this would stack the plots vertically. Note that we have to specify the variables inside the `vars()` function."
