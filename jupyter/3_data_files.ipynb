To start, we need to load our data into R: this requires identifying the type of data file we have (e.g. .csv, .xlsx, .dta) and finding the appropriate function to load in the data. This will create a data frame object containing the information from the file. After demonstrating how to load in such data, this chapter will show you how to find information about data columns, including finding missing values, summarizing columns, and subsetting the data. Additionally, we look at how to create new columns through some simple transformations.\n",

        "In general, the data you will be using will not be available in R packages and will instead exist in one or more data files on your personal computer. In order to load in this data to R, you need to use the function that corresponds to the file type you have. For example, you can load a .csv file using the `read.csv()` function in base R or using the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package, both of which were shown in [Chapter 1](https://alicepaul.github.io/health-data-science-in-r/book/1_intro_to_r.html). As an example, we load the `fake_names.csv` dataset below using both of these functions: looking at the print output below, we can see that there is slight difference in the data structure and data types storing the data between these two functions. The function `read.csv()` loads the data as a data frame, whereas the function `read_csv()` loads the data as a `spec_tbl_df`, a special type of data frame called a **tibble** that is used by the `tidyverse` packages. We will cover this data structure in more detail in [Chapter 5](https://alicepaul.github.io/health-data-science-in-r/book/5_data_transformations_summaries.html). For now, note that you can use either function to read in a .csv file."
