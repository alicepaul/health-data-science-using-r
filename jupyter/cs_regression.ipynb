This data contains information on 1,762 patients in rural South Africa and urban Uganda who presented at a health clinic with tuberculosis-related symptoms and who were tested for tuberculosis (TB) using Xpert MTB/RIF [@baik2020clinical]. Our goal will be to conduct a similar regression analysis to @baik2020clinical and use this data to derive a risk model for screening patients for treatment while awaiting Xpert results. Unlike @baik2020clinical, we will not restrict ourselves to simple integer risk score models. "
