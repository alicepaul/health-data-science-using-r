        "In this chapter, we put some of our R skills together in a case study. This case study focuses on data cleaning and pre-processing. We use the `tb_diagnosis_raw` data from the **HDSinRdata** package. This data contains information on 1,634 patients in rural South Africa who presented at a health clinic with tuberculosis-related symptoms and were tested for tuberculosis (TB) using Xpert MTB/RIF. Our goal is to clean this data to reflect the pre-processing described in @baik2020clinical. This paper uses this data to derive a simple risk score model for screening patients for treatment while awaiting Xpert results. We use the **tidyverse** packages as well as the summary tables from **gtsummary**."
