The `lrtest()` function from the **lmtest** package allows us to input two nested `glm` models and performs a corresponding Chi-squared likelihood ratio test. First, we need to ensure that our initial model is fit on the same data used in the stepwise selection. The output indicates a statistically significant improvement in the model likelihood with the inclusion of the other variables."

Create a new variable `tobacco_use` representing any tobacco use in the past 30 days (including e-cigarettes, cigarettes, and/or cigars) as well as a new variable `perceived_tobacco_use` equal to the maximum of the perceived cigarette and e-cig use. Then, create a new data frame `nyts_sub` that contains these two new columns as well as columns for sex, grades in the past year, psych distress, and family affluence. Finally, fit a logistic regression model with this new tobacco use variable as the outcome and all other selected variables as independent variables.\n",

Perform stepwise selection on your model from Question 1 with `direction = \"both\"`, setting the upper scope of the model selection procedure to be a model including all two-way interactions and the lower scope to be a model including only an intercept. To specify all possible interactions you can use the formula `\"tobacco_use ~ .^2\"`. Use the `tidy()` function to display the exponentiated estimated coefficients for the resulting model along with a confidence interval.\n",
