Examples include testing for positive correlations, performing two-sample paired t-tests, and testing for equal variance among groups.

To start, we compare the variance in abortion rates in 2021 between urban and rural counties using an F-test. Our null hypothesis for this test is that the variance in both groups is equal. The function `var.test()`\\index{R functions!var.test()@\\texttt{var.test()}} implements an F-test and has the same main arguments as the `t.test()` function: vectors `x` and `y` OR a `formula` and `data`, the alternative hypothesis `alternative`, and `conf.level`. Additionally, we can specify the hypothesized ratio of the variances through the argument `ratio` (default value 1). Note that this function assumes that the two samples come from normally distributed populations. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that the variances in rates are equal at the 0.05 level and print the estimate of the ratio of variances, which is around 1.11."
