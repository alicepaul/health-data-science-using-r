## Guideline for this repository

In this github repo, you can find Quarto file version of each chapter inside `book` folder along with the corresponding Jupyter notebook file in the `jupyter` folder. Most of data used in the examples is provided in the library `HDSinRdata`, but there are two toy datasets stored in the `data` folder inside the `book` folder.
