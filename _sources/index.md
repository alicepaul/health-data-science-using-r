# R for Health Data Science

This book is designed to serve as an interactive introduction to R for public health and health data science students. This book is written using Jupyter Book. You can download the corresponding jupyter notebook and pdf directly from each chapter or visit the github repository, which also includes corresponding R Markdown files. Alternatively, you can open each notebook using Google Colab or Binder. If you are unfamiliar with jupyter notebooks or R Markdown, we encourage you to start with Chapter 1: Intro to R, RStudio, and Jupyter.   

This site is written by Alice Paul with the support of Jialin Liu, Joanna Walsh, and Xinbei Yu. Please contact Alice Paul (alice_paul@brown.edu) with questions.
