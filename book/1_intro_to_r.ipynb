    "# Intro to R, RStudio, and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will introduce you to R as a programming language and how we can use this language in different ways: directly through the [R console](https://cran.rstudio.com/), using [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), and using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why R?\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some of the benefits to using R? \n",
    "* R is built for statisticians and data analysis.  \n",
    "* R is open source.  \n",
    "* R has most of the latest statistical methods available.  \n",
    "* R is flexible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since R is built for statisticians, it is built with data in mind. That comes in handy when we want to streamline how we process and analyze data. It also means that many statisticians working on new methods are publishing user-created packages in R so we have access to most methods of interest. R is also an interpreted language, which means that we do not have to compile our code into machine language first. What this means for you is that this allows for simpler syntax and more flexibility when writing our code, which also makes it a great first language to learn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is another interpreted language often used for data analysis. Both languages feature simple and flexible syntax. While python is more broadly developed for usage outside data science and statistical analysis, R is a great programming language for those in health data science. I use both langauges and find switching between them to be straightforward, but I do prefer R for anything related to data or statistical analyis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation of R and RStudio\n",
    "\n",
    "To run R on your computer, you will need to [download and install R](https://cran.rstudio.com/). This will allow you to open the R application or run R code interactively. However, to get the most of out programming with R, you will want to install RStudio, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R and python. RStudio offers a nice environment for writing, editing, running, and debugging R code. We will talk through more of the benefits of using RStudio below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each chapter in this book can be downloaded as an R markdown file. You can open this file in RStudio to run the presented code as you read. Alternatively, at the top of you can open each of these chapters as a Jupyter notebook through Binder. This will open an interactive, online session for you to run the R code. We recommend this option for the best viewing and learning experience. If you would like to run the Jupyter notebooks on your own machine, you will need to install [Jupyter](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and the associated [R kernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel)."

The assignment operator assigns whatever is on the right hand side of the operator to the name of the left hand side. We can now reference `x` by calling its name. Additionally, we can update its value by adding 1. In the second line of code, the computer first finds the value of the right hand side by finding the current value of `x` before adding 1 and assigning it back to `x`."
