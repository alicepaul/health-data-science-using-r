# R for Health Data Science

This book is designed to serve as an interactive introduction to R for public health and health data science students. This book is written using Jupyter Book. You can download the corresponding jupyter notebook and pdf directly from each chapter or visit the github repository, which also includes corresponding R Markdown files. Alternatively, you can open each notebook using Google Colab or Binder. This will allow you to directly run the code you see in each chapter and to test out your solutions to the exercises included. If this is your first time learning R or you are unfamiliar with jupyter notebooks or R Markdown, we encourage you to start with [Chapter 1: Intro to R, RStudio, and Jupyter](book/1_intro_to_r).   

This site is written by [Alice Paul](https://alicepaul.github.io/) with the support of Jialin Liu, Joanna Walsh, and Xinbei Yu. Please contact Alice Paul (alice_paul@brown.edu) with questions.
